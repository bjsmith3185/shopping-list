when adding item
    - adds but also doubles all existing items

wen removing items
    - removes item, if there is a double item that one of them stays



---------------------------
try having a function to put everything on the page on document load. put 
this in a function and call the function once.

have a .on (child_changed) function to call when the user submits or deletes an item.

can i add jquery .remove() and find the cooresponding id or class of the dom element and remove it that way?



try adding the on document load function for the putOnPage()
 this may keep the items from showing up twice after one is deleted



 or, delete all items under the store folder
   let the putonpage () repopulate it 

















on page load
    - get data stored
    - maybe use the .on("value")?
    - put data on page, html

add items to list
    - collect input into var
    - clear the input area
    - push var to the database
        - save input items
        - create a unique data-todo item, maybe using a counter++?
    

get data from database
    - retreive data
    - put data into dom
        - add class( data-todo)
        - add input var
        - add button
        - add checkbox

remove data from dom
    - use $(docuent).on click because it was created dynamically
    - use this to identify the data-value of the selected item
    - remove the item from the database
